            <h2>A little about me:</h2>
            <p>I grew up working class but always had an abiding interest in technology. The internet and I came of age at around
                the same time. I was always tinkering and helping neighbors and relatives with their computers. What was
                a nuisance to some was fun to me.<br><br> In high school, I elected to take a course that would have given
                me a certification in Cisco networking. Working with computers was the one thing I had always been naturally
                good at; as such, I phoned in the class and was left reeling when I failed the exam (passed the class, though!).
                I had built my entire future around that class and I was completely lost with regards to where I should go
                from there. I hadn’t had a lot of experience dealing with failure at that point, and I took it quite hard.<br><br>                So what followed after school was several years of trying on different careers; some of them fit more than
                others, but over time, I always came to feel unfulfilled. Inside, I knew what I wanted to do, and other work
                just wasn’t as satisfying to me. But as I got older, I didn’t see how I could make the transition into technology.<br><br>                The Iron Yard gave me an opportunity to try again. And though I wasn’t always satisfied with the work I was
                doing before, I gained a lot of valuable experience trying different things; I discovered that I am a natural
                leader and that I enjoy helping others be their best. I’m looking forward to taking all of this experience
                and carving out a space in this digital world!</p>
