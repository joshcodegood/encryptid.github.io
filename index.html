            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello. I'm Joshua Lawson and this is my landing page. Here is a little about me:<br><br> I tried to fight it.
                Tried to pretend it wasn't there. But it was, all the time, haunting me.<br><br> It started when I was young.
                The internet was just becoming a "thing". Thousands of people were signing into chat rooms preceded by that
                awful dial-up tone. I would help my neighbors and family members with their computers. "You're so good with
                computers!” they would exclaim. And I felt like a wizard. It seemed natural to me, but people were in awe
                of my ability. My career path, it seemed, was obvious.<br><br> But disaster struck teenage Josh when he came
                against an obstacle he was not mature enough to overcome: failure. That's right; I failed one of my certification
                tests.<br><br> I have grown a lot in the intervening years, but teenage Josh took his failure as a sign that
                he was not cut out to be in the tech industry, as he once believed. And so, with a heavy heart, I put away
                my pocket protector and put on my work boots. What followed was a series of menial jobs, each slightly better
                than the last, but never fulfilling.<br><br> When it came time to shift gears again, I asked myself what
                I truly wanted to do. The answer was simple; I loved technology. I wanted to be around it.<br><br> So I chose
                to pursue a career in Front End Web Development. I enrolled at The Iron Yard and embarked upon one of the
                most challenging and rewarding things I've ever done. And though I’m excited for what the future now holds,
                I wouldn't call all those other jobs a waste. On the contrary, I learned a lot about myself and what I can
                accomplish, about working for companies and what they expect, about working with clients and making them
                happy, and most of all, about working with people.<br><br> My work history to this point shows that I can
                do almost anything and my education shows that I can learn almost anything, quickly. I look forward to applying
                this to my future endeavors.<br><br>
